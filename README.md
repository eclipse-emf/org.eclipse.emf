# Eclipse Modeling Framework

Eclipse EMF&trade; is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building tools and other applications based on a structured data model.
From a model specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime support to produce a set of Java classes for the model,
a set of adapter classes that enable viewing and command-based editing of the model,
and a basic editor.
Models can be specified using annotated Java, XML documents, Xcore, or graphical modeling tools, then imported into EMF.
Most important of all, EMF provides the foundation for interoperability with other EMF-based tools and applications.

Eclipse XSD is a library that provides an API for manipulating the components of an XML Schema as described by the W3C XML Schema specifications, 
as well as anAPI for manipulating the DOM-accessible representation of XML.
