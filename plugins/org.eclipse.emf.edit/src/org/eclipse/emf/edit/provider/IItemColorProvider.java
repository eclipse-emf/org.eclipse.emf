/**
 * This is the interface implemented to provide a color for an item;
 * it receives delegated calls from IColorProvider.
 * Colors are expressed in a platform independent way as URIs in one of two forms:
 *<pre>
 *  color://rgb/&lt;red>/&lt;green>/&lt;blue>
 *  color://hsb/&lt;hue>/&lt;saturation>/&lt;brightness>
 *</pre>
 * The "rgb" form specifies the values for red, green, and blue as integral values in the range of 0-255.
 * The "hsb" form specifies the values for hue, saturation, and brightness as decimal values in the range of 0-360, 0-1, and 0-1 respectively.
 * The hue, saturation, or brightness can be specified as "foreground" or "background,
 * or can even be omitted as a shorthand to specify "foreground",
 * to indicate that the value of the current viewer's foreground or background color should be used as the specified value.
 * <p>
 * Other schemes may be supported. 
 * In particular, it's expected that forms that specify color based on named user preference will be supported.
