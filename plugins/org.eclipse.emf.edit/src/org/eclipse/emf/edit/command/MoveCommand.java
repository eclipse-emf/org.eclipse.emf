/**
 * The move command logically acts upon an owner object that has a collection-based feature 
 * containing an object that is to be moved to a new position within the collection.
 * The static create method delegates command creation to {@link EditingDomain#createCommand EditingDomain.createCommand},
 * which may or may not result in the actual creation of an instance of this class.
 * Like all the low level commands in this package, the move command is undoable.
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this class is low-level and EMF specific;
 * it allows an object to be moved to a new position within a many-valued feature of an owner,
 * i.e., it is equivalent of the call
 * <pre>
 *   ((EList)((EObject)owner).eGet((EStructuralFeature)feature)).move(index, object);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It can also be used as an equivalent to the call
 * <pre>
 *   ((EList)extent).move(index, object);
 * </pre>
 * which is how root objects are moved within the contents of a resource.
 * Like all the low-level commands in this package, the move command is undoable.
 *
 * <p>
 * A move command is an {@link OverrideableCommand}.
