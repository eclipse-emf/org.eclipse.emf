Incompatibility</a></b> 

<p>EMF 1.0.1 uses classpath variables in the java projects it
creates. The generator also updates the classpath during generation
(although this feature can be turned off via a genmodel property).
The gist of this is that there can be conflicts with the bare jar
classpath entries used in 1.0.0 projects and therefore, you need to
delete old 1.0.0 classpath entries and then regenerate to create
them correctly. Also, although plugin.property's merge correctly
now (see below), plugin.xml's do not. Because of this, you should
delete old 1.0.0 plugin.xml's and regenerate them for 1.0.1. We
also recommend deleting 1.0.0 genmodels, and recreating them in
1.0.1, because they now support proper reload with persistent
genmodel settings, while the 1.0.0 versions do not.<br />

<li><b><a id="emf_101b_2" name="emf_101b_2">Documentation
Plugin</a></b> 

<p>There is now a documentation plugin, org.eclipse.emf.doc,
included in the download. All the EMF documentation is now
available from the desktop Help menu. We've put the documentation
plugin into the Runtime zip file, so its download size has
increased by more than 2M. We're thinking about moving it into the
Source zip, or maybe into its own zip file, in the future. If you
have an opinion, please feel free to post it to the emf
newsgroup.<br />

<li><b><a id="emf_101b_3" name="emf_101b_3">Bug Fixes</a></b><br />
&nbsp; 

<ul>
<li>Importing a Rose model with nested packages, where the parent
package(s) have no classes in them, caused the generator to ignore
(not generate) all of the classes in the nested package(s).</li>

<li>If you imported annotated Java classes that were in the default
Java package (i.e., no explicit package), the importer crashed and
produced an empty editor window. Now it produces an error message
instead.</li>

<li>Java @model annotations no longer need to be on a line by
themselves in the comment. The importer will recognize @model
followed by 0 or more name=value pairs, anywhere in the comment.
This fixes a problem several people were having with the tutorial,
whereby the import from annotation wasn't finding any classes
because of the formatting of the comments.</li>

<li>Other minor bug fixes. Details available upon request.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b><a id="emf_101b_4" name="emf_101b_4">Generator
Enhancements</a></b><br />
&nbsp; 

<ul>
<li>The Ecore Model Project wizard now lets you create a genmodel
from an Ecore XMI file. In 1.0.0 it was only possible to create a
genmodel from a Rose model or annotated Java files.</li>

<li>You can now reload a genmodel from any source, not just from
Rose. The "Reload from Rose" menu item is now just
"Reload...".</li>

<li>Added the ability to control whether you want the edit and
editor code to be generated into their own plugin/project or not.
In 1.0.0, you had no choice but to generate the edit and editor
components into separate plugins.</li>

<li>Added more flexibility in the EMF.Edit generation. You can now
choose (by setting properties in the genmodel editor) which classes
to generate item providers for. In 1.0.0, you were forced to have
one for every class. Also, which features should be properties and
which should generate notification, is now user controllable.</li>

<li>The generator now merges plugin.properties as well as Java
files. In 1.0.0, if you regenerated an edit or editor plugin, it
would not change or overwrite an existing plugin.properties file.
If the model had new properties, you needed to manually add them,
or delete the old plugin.properties file before regenerating.
Plugin.xml's still need to be deleted if you want to regenerate
them.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b><a id="emf_101b_5" name="emf_101b_5">Added a basic
EMF-generated Ecore model editor</a></b> 

<p>You can use it, instead of the text editor, to view or edit
".ecore" model files. Of course, once we have nice graphical Ecore
editors, this won't be nearly as interesting.</p>

<li><b><a id="emf_101b_6" name="emf_101b_6">Technology Preview -
Import model from XML Schema</a></b> 

<p>In EMF 1.0.1 you can import your ecore model from an XML Schema,
in addition to Rose or annotated Java. To enable this support, you
need to download and install the <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org/xsd">XML Schema Project</a> plugins
first. Here is <a href="docs/clibmod/library.xsd">library.xsd</a>,
the Library model expressed in XML Schema. To use it, run the Ecore
Model Project wizard and choose "Load from XML Schema" when
prompted. This is essentially a third option for step 1 (i.e., 1c)
in the <a href="docs/clibmod/clibmod_main.html">tutorial</a>. Give
it a try.</p>

<p>One very important difference (advantage) to using XML Schema to
define the model is that, in addition to the default XMI, instances
of the model will (not currently, but in the coming weeks) be
serializable according to the Schema.</p>

<p>Another interesting observation is that the "Book.author" and
"Writer.books" reference types, and the fact that they are opposite
ends of a bidirectional association, are not expressed in the XML
Schema. Consequently, the generator will simply treat them as two
independent one-way references of type EObject. We're looking into
ways of annotating the schema (similar to the Java annotation
approach) with the missing information. If you have any ideas or
suggestions, please feel free to post them to the emf
newsgroup.</p>

<p>Note: This support is very preliminary and highly subject to
change. It is meant to demonstrate the concepts and works well only
with simple schemas.</p>

<li><b><a id="emf_101b_7" name="emf_101b_7">Proposal to add
annotations to Ecore model objects</a></b> 

<p>Class EAnnotation has been added to the Ecore model as a
proposed design for supporting annotations which follows closely
the design of the XML Schema model's XSDAnnotation. The current
design uses a &lt;&lt;0..*&gt;&gt; details : String, which we
recognize is unacceptably limiting and plan to change it, probably
to a Map, once we've worked out the details of serialization
support for a Map. We would like to solicit feedback on the
EAnnotation design. It will definitely change before the design is
committed to a Release Build. For example, adding a black diamond
relation from EAnnotation to EObject would make it essentially
identical in function to XSDAnnotation; it would mean that no one
would ever have to extend EAnnotation in order to add annotations
and it would ensure that the arbitrary EObjects are well separated
and have a well managed lifetime relative to that which they
annotate.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Generated code is now formatted according to the project (Java
Code Formatter) preferences.</li>

<li>EMF.Edit (e.g., item providers) can now be used in stand-alone
applications (see FAQ for details).</li>

<li>More XML Schema Technology preview. Along with the Java
classes, an XML Schema can now be generated for an Ecore model.
This is the opposite of the import from Schema support (described
above).</li>

<li>EAnnotation design (described above) has been completed.</li>

<li>Added support for map (i.e., EMap) type attributes. See
EAnnotation (attribute "details") for an example.</li>

<li>Some XMI and XML Resource implementation restructuring.</li>

<li>Added simple logging support. There is now a log() method
callable on generated Plugin classes.</li>

<li>More minor bug fixes and cleanup...</li>
